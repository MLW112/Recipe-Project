    <h3>Make the dough the night before you are planning your meal</h3>
    
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>17 1/2 ounces bread flour, plus extra for shaping</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li> 
         <li>12 fluid ounces filtered water</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons cornmeal</li>
         <br></br>
</ul>
<h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together the flour, yeast, and salt in a large mixing bowl.
             Add the water and stir until combined. Cover the bowl with plastic 
             wrap and allow to sit at room temperature for 19 hours.</li>
            <li>After 19 hours, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work 
                surface. Punch down the dough and turn it over onto itself a 
                couple of times. Cover with a tea towel and allow to rest 
                15 minutes. After 15 minutes, shape the dough into a ball. 
                Coat hands with flour, if needed, to prevent sticking. 
                Sprinkle the tea towel with half of the cornmeal and lay 
                the dough on top of it, with the seam side down. Sprinkle 
                the top of the dough with the other half of the cornmeal and 
                cover with the towel. Allow to rise until the dough has doubled
                 in size, another 2 to 3 hours.</li>
                 <li>Oven baking: While the dough is rising the second time,
                     heat the oven to 450°F. Place a 4- to 5-quart Dutch oven 
                     in the oven while it heats. Once the dough is ready, carefully
                      transfer it to the hot Dutch oven. Cover and bake for 30 minutes.
                       Remove the lid and bake </li>
